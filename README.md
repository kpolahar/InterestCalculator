# About InterestCalculator

The purpose of this project is for me to demonstrate my skills, coding style, and perhaps most importantly, my work process, to a potential employer and their development team, to help them determine whether or not I would be a good fit for their team and its needs.

The coding challenge focuses in particular on test-driven development (TDD), though it does not specify a particular testing framework which must be used. It is apparent that one particular skill set which is important to this team is a level of familiarity and capability with at least some form of unit testing. The document also mentions the important of a firm grasp on SOLID programming principles.
